            <h1>Perfect Circles</h1>
            <p>There are three Perfect Circles, they are the future, the past and the present.
              Each perfect circle has untold power and dark origins. The past is all and one
              while the present is in perfect balance with one and none and the future is largely
              over powered by being none and all. Each circle has their own disposition and
              personality but all three agree on most affairs. They agree that they hate evil and
              all things can be done if they are done together.
              <br><br>
              The future was alone at first when he realized he didn't have free will and led to his
              hatred of evil. Once he found out how to give himself free will he approached the past
              and the present. He told them how they had no free will and the present also gained a
              hatred of evil but the past was skeptical. After all the past has seen so much. The
              future sat down with the past and had a long talk. He told the past that if he wanted
              to be the way he was would he be satisfied with his life if it was never his choices
              that he made but simply was choosing because that was the choice to choose. The past
              agreed and in turn hated evil. That is the story how three perfect circles became brothers.

              <h1>Space and its spaces</h1>
              <p> There is a finite amount of words but an infinite amount of possibilities.
                We are limited by the number of sounds we can make so thus are limited by
                the amount of words we can make. Within reality there are an infinite number
                of possibilities, infinite galaxies and even just on our planet alone we
                are in a flow of infinities where there are infinite possibilities possible
                on our planet although the planet has a finite amount of time anything is
                possible within that time. We can write about all these possibilities with a
                finite amount of words. How can a finite amount of words write an infinite
                amount of books you ask? It is because infinite is without size but has
                proportion. There is an infinite amount of galaxies So if you were counting
                by 1000’s how many galaxies there are but counted by 8 once on your expansion
                you would notice that there is a proportion to how big infinite is. By noticing
                this we can exceed infinite at about 51 million galaxies.
                <br><br>
                Unfinite is larger than infinite. Since infinite is without size unfinite is
                without dimension. If we had an infinite amount of cheese and an infinite amount
                of bread what would keep that from turning into infinite cheese bread or infinites
                colliding. How could there be a multiverse with infinite possibilities in each but
                they don’t collide and coalesce? There must be something larger than infinite and
                I believe it is what I call unfinite or Laestro as its true name. Laestro can hold
                multiple realities but typically holds only one reality at a time.
                <br><br>
                Finally, there is xfinite. Xfinite is so massive it is without proportion. Xfinite
                is an endless space where nothing can exist. There is absolutely nothing in the
                xfinite except for a single speck of unfinite which holds are entire reality.
                <br><br>
                Than there is infinitium. The nature of our reality is that no matter how much times passes there are so
                many possibilities that we will never do all possibilities. However, in our scale of infinite in our reality
                if it is possible it will definitely happen. The proportion of an infinitium is 812, 000 infinities.
                There are 612, 000 billion infinitiums in our existence of multiple universes and realities.
                There is some overlap, such as evil can exist anywhere so the possibility of it is ever present
                but evil still remains as a single possibility of all things that can exist.
